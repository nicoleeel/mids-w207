    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "\n",
    "a) K Nearest Neighbors does not work well for this because this method is trying to classify documents based on \"similar\" documents, but the nature of these documents is that very few vocabulary words are present in any given document, so similary would be sparse and hard to find. With a vocabulary of 26000+, only a few out of those words will be in any one document, so finding the \"nearest neighbor\" with a similar pattern of words would be hard to do. There are also probably a lot of words that are common across most documents like \"the\" or \"it\" or other generic words that don't distinguish between document classes as well as K Nearest Neighbors would like them to. This might also explain why the best K is so large - it might be having trouble finding similar neighbors to optimize the accuracy and so it just keeps trying to look for more neighbors to help the algorithm, but it's just not a good model for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) I think logistic regression isn't working as well as Naive Bayes because there's just such a large feature space (26000+) that it's probably very difficult to distinguish which feature is the most distinguishing for each class. Since logistic regression is discriminative, it's trying to find which features help distinguish the classes, but there are so many words that it's probably hard to sort through the noise and find which one actually helps classify the documents. For Naive Bayes, even though the independence assumptions fall short with sentences, it's more generalizable because it tries to find a general model for each class. Given a certain pattern of words, it picks a class based on which one is the most likely to have returned that pattern. And with our document classifications, that's probably a better way - to count the different times certain words appear and try to figure out which subject generated that pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "c) Smaller values of C specify stronger regularization, so the smaller the C, the more penalty the model will give to larger feature spaces. So with the smallest C value of 0.0001 (strongest regularization), we see that the sum of the squared weights is the smallest because the regularization factor is trying to minimize the penalty and is choosing the smallest weight vector. The largest value of C (lowest regularization) doesn't care about minimizing the weight vector as much and will choose models with larger coefficient vectors as shown. As the value of C increases, the coefficients increase."

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "TfidfVetorizer accounts for words that may hold very little meaning in distinguishing between documents but shows up in disproportionately high frequencies in a lot of documents. For instance, words like \"the\" \"and\" \"an\" \"or\" etc probably show up a large number of times in all documents and do very little to distinguish between classes, yet because their counts are so high, they get weighted high. TFIDF transforms and normalizes word counts relative to their frequency and how many documents contain the word so that the vectorizer doesn't overweight frequent, common, low-power words.\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the top 3 documents with the highest R ratios, I can come to a general conclusion that it seems like the predictor classified the two Mormon-related texts as \"computer graphics\" due to the language included regarding \"files\" or \"online\" or \"version\". The first, long text regarding a book on Mormonism discusses computers, files, printers, which are some of the highest weighted words for the 'computer graphics' label. Since the text is about publishing, it makes sense that the predictor confuses it with the language of graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other document that is about atheism that wrongly got categorized as religion first primarily makes sense because the two topics are so intertwined that they should be mixed up easily. But specifically looking at our document, we see that it's a very short sentence about violence in which \"24 children' were killed. \"children\" actually is the 10th highest weighted feature in the religion topic, so given the short sentence, it makes sense to be classified as religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea to fix this is to have 'trigger' words in which just the presence of a certain word would automatically categorize a document a certain way. The first 2 documents are about Mormonism and should be automatically put into 'religion.' Maybe the best way isn't to make it automatic, but just to manually assign higher weights to certain words we KNOW should trigger a classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another more feasible way to fix this using the features in tfid vectorizer is to change the ngram range to include 2-word combinations so that single words like \"file\" that happen to show up in texts about religion/mormonism aren't incorrectly categorized as computer graphics. This should make our features more specifically tailored to their correct labels because features wil have more context. "
